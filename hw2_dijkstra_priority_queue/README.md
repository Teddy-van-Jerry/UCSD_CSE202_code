# HW2: Dijkstra Priority Queue

## Implementation Problem
Implement Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue for a variety of sizes *n*,
for complete graphs with edge weights randomly chosen real numbers between 0 and 1.
How does the number of decrease-key operations actually scale with *n*?
How does this compare to the worst-case number of decrease-key operations? Why are the two different, if they are?
Present your data clearly, and explain how you draw
your conclusions.
